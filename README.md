## You want to use it

Cool, be sure to know that the project is still work in progress so I won't give any guarantees for it to work.
Also make sure to allow it to keep the localstorage otherwise all your work is gone once the browser is closed.

With that aside you can simply go to https://modules.aro-playground.ch and start trying it out.

## Want to contribute
